  MARVIN PERSONALITY TRANSFER - CLAUDE VERSION

  Goal: Compare Claude's extended thinking vs OpenAI's structured outputs

  Claude advantages:
  - Native extended thinking mode (better for reasoning)
  - Longer context (200K+)
  - Different training, may handle personas differently

  Comparison metrics:
  - Reasoning quality (steps clarity)
  - Persona consistency (depressed tone throughout)
  - Answer correctness (verification rates)
  - Cost ($10-15 for Claude vs $4-8 for OpenAI)

  Expected output:
  - 800 samples with Claude's thinking blocks
  - Mapped to same BestOfNRecord schema
  - Direct comparison with OpenAI version
